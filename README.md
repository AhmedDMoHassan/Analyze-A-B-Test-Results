# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results:
Udacity Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree September 2022 - November 2022
# Project Details:
For this project, I will be working to perform and analyze the results of an A/B test for an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to build a code to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
# Specifications:
## Code Quality:
+ All code cells can be run without error.
+ Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.
## Statistical Analyses:
+ results from different analyses are correctly interpreted for both the **A/B** approach and the **Regression** one.
+ statistical numeric values are calculated correctly.
+ Conclusions include both - statistical reasoning and practical reasoning for the situation.
